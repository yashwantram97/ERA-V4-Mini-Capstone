# Before vs After: Progressive Resizing Comparison

## Before: Manual Schedule ❌

### Configuration (configs/g5_config.py)
```python
# Old approach: Fixed epoch boundaries
PROG_RESIZING_FIXRES_SCHEDULE = {
    0: (128, True),    # Epochs 0-9: 128px, train augs
    10: (224, True),   # Epochs 10-49: 224px, train augs
    50: (256, True),   # Epochs 50-59: 256px, test augs
}
```

### Issues:
- ❌ Fixed epoch boundaries (not adaptable to different epoch counts)
- ❌ Abrupt resolution jumps (128→224 is a big jump)
- ❌ Not based on research/proven hyperparameters
- ❌ No curriculum learning (jumps instead of progression)
- ❌ Hard to customize for different scenarios

### Training Progression:
```
Epochs 0-9:   128x128 px ━━━━━━━━━━
Epochs 10-49: 224x224 px ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Epochs 50-59: 256x256 px ━━━━━━━━━━
```
**Problems**: 
- Sudden jump from 128→224 (1.75x size increase)
- Limited time at 128px (only 17% of training)
- Starts higher than optimal (128 vs 112)

## After: MosaicML Composer Approach ✅

### Configuration (configs/g5_config.py)
```python
from src.callbacks import create_progressive_resize_schedule

# New approach: Percentage-based, research-backed
PROG_RESIZING_FIXRES_SCHEDULE = create_progressive_resize_schedule(
    total_epochs=EPOCHS,
    target_size=224,          # Standard ImageNet resolution
    initial_scale=0.5,        # Start at 50% (112px) - MosaicML recommended
    delay_fraction=0.5,       # First 50% at initial scale - MosaicML recommended
    finetune_fraction=0.2,    # Last 20% at full size - MosaicML recommended
    size_increment=4,         # Round to multiples of 4 - MosaicML recommended
    use_fixres=False,         # Optional FixRes
    fixres_size=256
)
```

### Advantages:
- ✅ Percentage-based (adapts to 30, 60, 100, or any epoch count)
- ✅ Smooth progression (112→120→128→136→144→...→224)
- ✅ Research-backed (MosaicML validated on ImageNet)
- ✅ True curriculum learning (gradual difficulty increase)
- ✅ Easy to customize (change percentages, not epochs)

### Training Progression (60 epochs):
```
Phase 1 - Delay (0-29, 50%):
  112x112 px ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Phase 2 - Progressive (30-47, 30%):
  112 → 120 → 128 → 136 → 144 → 156 → 168 → 176 → 184 → 192 → 200 → 212 → 224
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Phase 3 - Fine-tune (48-59, 20%):
  224x224 px ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```
**Benefits**:
- Smooth curriculum: gradual steps (4-8px increments)
- More time at small resolution (50% vs 17%)
- Starts smaller (112 vs 128) = faster early training
- Proven to improve speed/accuracy tradeoff

## Performance Impact

### Computational Speedup

| Resolution | Pixels | Compute Time | Speedup |
|------------|--------|--------------|---------|
| 112px | 12,544 | 0.25x | **4.0x faster** |
| 128px | 16,384 | 0.33x | 3.0x faster |
| 160px | 25,600 | 0.51x | 2.0x faster |
| 224px | 50,176 | 1.00x | baseline |

### Time Savings (60 Epochs)

**Before (Manual Schedule):**
- Epochs 0-9 (17%):   128px @ 3x speed = 5.7% time
- Epochs 10-49 (67%): 224px @ 1x speed = 67% time
- Epochs 50-59 (17%): 256px @ 0.76x speed = 22.4% time
- **Total: ~95% of baseline time**

**After (Composer Schedule):**
- Epochs 0-29 (50%):  112px @ 4x speed = 12.5% time
- Epochs 30-47 (30%): Progressive @ ~2x speed = 15% time
- Epochs 48-59 (20%): 224px @ 1x speed = 20% time
- **Total: ~47.5% of baseline time**

**🚀 Result: ~50% faster training (2x speedup) compared to manual schedule!**

## Flexibility Comparison

### Before: Change Training to 100 Epochs
```python
# Have to manually recalculate epoch boundaries!
PROG_RESIZING_FIXRES_SCHEDULE = {
    0: (128, True),    # How long? 🤔
    ??: (224, True),   # When to switch? 🤔
    ??: (256, True),   # When to start FixRes? 🤔
}
```

### After: Change Training to 100 Epochs
```python
# Just change one parameter!
PROG_RESIZING_FIXRES_SCHEDULE = create_progressive_resize_schedule(
    total_epochs=100,  # ✅ Everything else adapts automatically!
    target_size=224,
    initial_scale=0.5,
    delay_fraction=0.5,
    finetune_fraction=0.2,
    size_increment=4
)
# Automatically becomes:
# - Epochs 0-49: 112px
# - Epochs 50-79: 112→224px progression
# - Epochs 80-99: 224px
```

## Customization Examples

### Want Faster Ramp-Up?
```python
# Before: Have to manually recalculate all epochs
{0: (128, True), 5: (224, True), 55: (256, True)}  # Guessing!

# After: Just adjust percentages
create_progressive_resize_schedule(
    delay_fraction=0.3,      # Start progressing earlier
    finetune_fraction=0.3,   # More time at full resolution
    # Everything else stays the same!
)
```

### Want Different Target Size?
```python
# Before: Have to create new schedule from scratch
{0: (???, True), ??: (???, True), ??: (???, True)}  # 🤔

# After: Change one parameter
create_progressive_resize_schedule(
    target_size=288,         # ✅ Automatically: 144→288
    initial_scale=0.5,       # Starts at 144px (50% of 288)
    # Everything else adapts!
)
```
