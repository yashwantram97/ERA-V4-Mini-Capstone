# Batch Size Differences: LR Finder vs Training

## 🤔 The Question

**"Is it OK to use different batch sizes in LR finder and training?"**

Your setup:
- **LR Finder (G5)**: batch_size = 64 (on 1 GPU)
- **Training (G5)**: batch_size = 256 (across 4 GPUs)

---

## ✅ **Short Answer: YES, it's perfectly fine!**

In fact, **you're already doing the right thing** because the **per-GPU batch size matches**!

## 🎓 Deep Dive: Understanding Batch Size in DDP

### The Two Types of Batch Size

In distributed training, there are two concepts:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Total Batch Size = batch_size × num_gpus                   │
│  Per-GPU Batch Size = batch_size ÷ num_gpus (config value)  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
```

### Your Actual Setup

| Environment | Config Batch | GPUs | Per-GPU Batch | Total Batch |
|-------------|--------------|------|---------------|-------------|
| **LR Finder (G5)** | 64 | 1 | **64** | 64 |
| **Training (G5)**  | 256 | 4 | **64** | 256 |
| | | | | |
| **LR Finder (P3)** | 32 | 1 | **32** | 32 |
| **Training (P3)**  | 256 | 8 | **32** | 256 |

**Key Insight**: The **per-GPU batch size matches** between LR finder and training! 🎯

## 📊 Why Per-GPU Batch Size Matters

### What Determines Learning Rate?

There are **two schools of thought**:

#### 1. **Total Batch Size Matters** (Linear Scaling Rule)

**Theory** (Goyal et al., 2017):
```
If total_batch_size increases by k → scale LR by k
```

**Example:**
- batch_size = 64, LR = 0.1
- batch_size = 256 (4x larger), LR = 0.4 (4x larger)

**Formula:**
```python
LR_new = LR_base × (total_batch_new / total_batch_base)
```

#### 2. **Per-GPU Batch Size Matters** (Gradient Noise)

**Theory** (Hoffer et al., 2017):
```
What matters is the gradient noise per update,
which depends on per-GPU batch size
```

**Example:**
- 1 GPU with batch=64: gradient computed from 64 samples
- 4 GPUs with batch=64 each: each GPU computes gradient from 64 samples
- **Same gradient noise per GPU** → same optimal LR!

### Which One is Right?

**Both have merit**, but in practice:

✅ **Per-GPU batch size matching** works very well in practice
✅ This is what most practitioners do (find LR on 1 GPU, train on N GPUs)
✅ PyTorch DDP aggregates gradients, but per-GPU dynamics matter

## 🧪 Empirical Evidence

### Research Findings

**1. Goyal et al. (2017)** - "Training ImageNet in 1 Hour"
- Linear scaling works up to batch_size=8192
- Requires warmup for very large batches
- But: They kept per-GPU batch constant at 32!

**2. You et al. (2020)** - "Large Batch Optimization for Deep Learning"
- Per-GPU batch size affects gradient variance
- Keeping per-GPU batch constant = stable training

**3. Practical Experience** (Fast.ai, PyTorch Lightning)
- Find LR on 1 GPU → train on N GPUs = standard practice
- Works if per-GPU batches are similar
- May need slight adjustment for very different batch sizes

### Your Configuration is Optimal! ✅

```python
# G5 Setup
LR_FINDER: 1 GPU × 64 batch = 64 samples per update
TRAINING:  4 GPU × 64 batch = 256 samples per update (aggregated)

# Each GPU still processes 64 samples → same gradient noise
# DDP averages gradients across GPUs → smooth learning
```

**Result**: The LR found with batch=64 works great with 4×64=256!

## 📐 When Does Batch Size Difference Matter?

### ✅ Safe Scenarios (No Adjustment Needed)

1. **Matching per-GPU batch** (your case!)
   - LR finder: 64 on 1 GPU
   - Training: 64 per GPU × 4 GPUs
   - ✅ No LR adjustment needed

2. **Small differences** (within 2x)
   - LR finder: 32 on 1 GPU  
   - Training: 64 on 1 GPU
   - ✅ LR might need ~1.5x adjustment, but often works as-is

3. **Using OneCycle scheduler** (your case!)
   - OneCycle explores LR range during training
   - Self-corrects if LR is slightly off
   - ✅ Very robust to batch size variations

### ⚠️ Scenarios That Need Adjustment

1. **Very different total batches** (>4x difference)
   ```python
   # LR finder: batch=32 on 1 GPU (total=32)
   # Training: batch=512 on 1 GPU (total=512)
   # → Consider scaling LR by sqrt(512/32) ≈ 4x
   ```

2. **No learning rate scheduler**
   ```python
   # Fixed LR throughout training
   # → More sensitive to exact LR value
   ```

3. **Extreme batch sizes** (>8192)
   ```python
   # Very large batches need:
   # - Linear scaling
   # - Warmup period
   # - Special considerations
   ```

## 🎯 Practical Guidelines

### Current Setup (Recommended) ✅

```python
# Local (1 GPU)
LR_FINDER: batch=64, LR=2.11e-3
TRAINING:  batch=64, LR=2.11e-3  # Same per-GPU batch ✅

# G5 (4 GPUs)
LR_FINDER: batch=64 (1 GPU), LR=2.11e-3
TRAINING:  batch=256 (4×64), LR=2.11e-3  # Same per-GPU batch ✅

# P3 (8 GPUs)
LR_FINDER: batch=32 (1 GPU), LR=2.11e-3
TRAINING:  batch=256 (8×32), LR=2.11e-3  # Same per-GPU batch ✅
```

**No adjustment needed!** The per-GPU batch sizes match perfectly.

### If You Want to Be Extra Careful

```python
# Run LR finder with different batch sizes, compare results
python find_lr.py --config g5 --batch-size 32 --runs 3
python find_lr.py --config g5 --batch-size 64 --runs 3
python find_lr.py --config g5 --batch-size 128 --runs 3

# Usually they're within 20-30% of each other
```

### Linear Scaling (If Needed)

```python
# If you use very different batch sizes:
LR_scaled = LR_base × sqrt(batch_new / batch_base)

# Example:
# Found LR with batch=32: 1.0e-3
# Training with batch=128: 1.0e-3 × sqrt(128/32) = 2.0e-3

# Why sqrt and not linear?
# - Linear scaling: very aggressive, can be unstable
# - Square root: more conservative, often works better
# - See: Hoffer et al., 2017
```

## 📊 What the Research Says

### Linear Scaling Rule (Goyal et al., 2017)

**When it works:**
- ✅ Large batches (up to 8k)
- ✅ With warmup
- ✅ When training from scratch

**Limitations:**
- ❌ May be too aggressive for very large batches
- ❌ Requires careful warmup schedule
- ❌ Doesn't account for per-GPU dynamics

### Square Root Scaling (Hoffer et al., 2017)

**When it works:**
- ✅ More conservative
- ✅ Better for moderate batch size changes
- ✅ Accounts for gradient variance

**Formula:**
```
LR_new = LR_base × sqrt(batch_new / batch_base)
```

### OneCycle + Constant Per-GPU Batch (Howard & Smith, 2018)

**Best practice:**
- ✅ Find LR with similar per-GPU batch
- ✅ Use OneCycle scheduler
- ✅ Let scheduler adapt during training

**Your setup follows this!** ✅

---

## 🧪 Experiment: Test Your Setup

If you want to verify, here's what to check:

### 1. Training Stability

```bash
# Train with found LR
python train.py --config g5

# Watch for signs of instability:
# - Loss exploding ❌
# - Loss not decreasing ❌
# - Accuracy improving ✅
```

### 2. Compare Different Batch Sizes

```bash
# Find LR with different batch sizes
python find_lr.py --config g5 --batch-size 32 --runs 3
python find_lr.py --config g5 --batch-size 64 --runs 3
python find_lr.py --config g5 --batch-size 128 --runs 3

# Compare results - usually within 2x of each other
```

### 3. Fine-Tune if Needed

```python
# If training seems unstable:
LEARNING_RATE = found_lr * 0.5  # More conservative

# If training seems too slow:
LEARNING_RATE = found_lr * 1.5  # More aggressive
```

## 📖 Common Misconceptions

### ❌ "Must use exact same batch size in LR finder and training"

**Reality**: Per-GPU batch size matters more than total batch size

### ❌ "Linear scaling always required"

**Reality**: Only for very large batch size differences (>4x)

### ❌ "LR finder results don't transfer to multi-GPU"

**Reality**: They transfer very well if per-GPU batches match

### ❌ "Need to re-run LR finder on multi-GPU setup"

**Reality**: Single-GPU LR finder is faster and works just as well

---

## 🎯 Summary & Recommendations

### Your Current Setup ✅

```
LR Finder (G5): 64 samples/GPU
Training (G5):  64 samples/GPU (256 total across 4 GPUs)
                ↑
                Perfectly matched!
```

### Why It Works

1. ✅ **Per-GPU batch sizes match** (most important!)
2. ✅ **OneCycle scheduler** adapts during training
3. ✅ **Standard practice** used by PyTorch Lightning, Fast.ai
4. ✅ **Backed by research** (Goyal 2017, Hoffer 2017)

### When to Worry

Only worry if:
- ❌ Very different per-GPU batches (>4x difference)
- ❌ No learning rate scheduler (fixed LR)
- ❌ Extreme batch sizes (>8192 total)
- ❌ Training shows instability

### Best Practices

1. ✅ **Keep per-GPU batch consistent** (you're doing this!)
2. ✅ **Use OneCycle scheduler** (you're doing this!)
3. ✅ **Run LR finder multiple times** (you're doing this!)
4. ✅ **Monitor training stability** (always good practice)

# Rule of Thumb:
# ✅ Match per-GPU batch sizes → use same LR
# ⚠️  2-4x batch difference → consider sqrt scaling
# ❌ >4x batch difference → use linear scaling + warmup

# Your Setup (OPTIMAL):
LR_FINDER:  64 samples/GPU → LR = 2.11e-3
TRAINING:   64 samples/GPU → LR = 2.11e-3  ✅

# Scaling Formulas (if needed):
LR_linear = LR_base × (batch_new / batch_base)
LR_sqrt   = LR_base × sqrt(batch_new / batch_base)

# When to Adjust:
# - Same per-GPU batch: NO adjustment needed ✅
# - 2x difference:      Try sqrt scaling
# - 4x+ difference:     Use linear scaling
# - >8192 batch:        Add warmup + linear scaling
